Project Summary: 
This a smart contract project is written and completed for IBM Blockchain Course (i.am-vitalize Cybersecurity specialization track).
My team was task to provide a blockchain solution, leveraging on finding through our Enterprise Design Thinking session.
We made the decision as a team take up the challenge to improve the liquidity of real-estate assets in Singapore, through identifying the inefficiencies in the current real-estate transfer process and highlight possible improvements through blockchain (hyperledger).
Project is written leveraging on Hyperledger fabric samples(fabcar) as reference.

Personal Learning Points: 
.Areas to Improve the Project are written within the Smart-Contract as comments.
.I underestimate my ability to read and write codes using samples as reference for the project.
.Propose blockchain solution will require broader public awareness and government support for possible adoption moving forward.
.Encounter several problems while attempting to learn identity management through hyperledger tutorials. 
.undestanding identity management will provide me with sufficient knowledge to handle money management of Buyer/Seller/Bank in the real-estate transfer process in the project.
